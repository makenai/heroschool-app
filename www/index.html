      <h2>History</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Hero School, as a Transformational Leadership Model, includes licensed facilitators and organizations including non-profits like Hero School Initiatives. Each Character Change® leader and provider is guided by the overarching vision of founder, Tiger Todd: “To help people be free to live the lives they were meant for.”</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Backgrond</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Following his philanthropy, Mr. Todd was led to Ethel Pearson Park in his hometown of Las Vegas. On this Saturday, 1800 homeless people were lined up to receive a hot meal from the charity he was supporting. Mr. Todd thought, “Was this all that could be done?”</p>
	<br>
	<p>Having retired from his electronics business, he applied his penchant for troubleshooting back to the park the following week, ultimately making it his life’s mission to find out why so many people were in this condition, and change their history.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Through his direct interviews that first day in the park and over the next couple of weeks, Mr. Todd kept hearing the same four things – evoke responses indicating the same four habits. He assumed these were the root causes of homelessness. Clearly one couldn’t run a business or even be employed by one by exhibiting any one of these behaviors. The following week, Mr. Todd rented a stage and 300 chairs, collaborated with numerous businesses to build a sound system capable of reaching deep into the neighborhood, and recruited 20 of his friends and clients for his first outreach and “Hero School” on a cold December Day in 1995.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Mr. Todd told the homeless they’d have to sit through his class before they received food, clothing and goods, whether they liked it or not. A little over three years later, over 9,200 of the 10,000 homeless individuals attending these ad hoc classes had changed their lives. With only 13 homeless people left in the park in 1999, and the homeless census indicating the population in Las Vegas had decreased by nearly 10,000 during that 3-year stretch, Mr. Todd redirected his energy and resources into prevention through public school presentations.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Using the newly-developed Hero School model before homelessness, he pioneered Academic Engagement in 1998, inspiring teens to learn from adults – instead of TV or each other. Test scores instantly rose by double-digits, attendance increased as did graduation rates, but only with the 200,000 students in Tiger’s assemblies.</p>

		<h3>Make Your School a Hero School</h3>
		<p>The Hero School Academic Engagement Model simply identifies and supplies what’s missing in Public Education. 14 years of active research with unparalleled results indicate it’s not the kids, it’s not the teachers, and it’s not the parents. It’s that the kids and their inner needs have changed faster than our education system and its need response did.</p>
		<p>When used together with student-centered educators and human-centered outcomes, Hero School Academic Engagement interventions have been shown to ignite engagement and motivate learning in hours instead of years. Even among the worst performers and behavioral students, increases in attendance and standardized test results – often more than 30% – occur in a matter of days and weeks, against historical decreases of up to 22% each year without a Hero School Intervention. That’s Change. That’s fast. And it’s uniquely Hero School.</p>
		<h3>HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO RE-WRITE THE EDUCATION SENTENCE FOR YOUR KIDS?</h3>
		<p>How did we find out what was missing in the education of American youth? We asked one overlooked, yet essential question:</p>
		<h3>WHAT DO TODAY’S YOUNG PEOPLE ”NEED TO HEAR” TO BECOME WHO THEY “NEED TO BE?”</h3>
		<p>Students today don’t need any more adults telling them “how it is,” particularly from the perspective of “how it was.” It is clear that even then adults in this technological generation could benefit from “revaluing their own values” and success definitions to see if they still hold water. What is important to you?</p>
		<p>What our youth need are teachers, coaches, experts – authentic leaders – who have the courage to first validate what is important to them, and yet who simultaneously can inspire them to learn the life strategies and often difficult lessons that will help them find their path through the integrating of their inner and outer lives</p>
		<p>Hero School® is that unique communication vehicle that quickly, seamlessly, and painlessly connects the inner needs and paths of today’s young people with the essential lessons taught by today’s educators, employers, experts and movies.</p>
		<p>Hero School® further optimizes the relationships between students and the unique role of educators, employers and experts within the Education Equation, within their community and even in the “Hero Movie” that will be their future life.</p>
		<p>Hero School® programs rapidly motivate continual learning and character development within and among students, while simultaneously motivating respect for and empowerment for and among educators and administrators.</p>
		<h3>THE RESEARCH WOULD INDICATE THAT MORE RESEARCH IS THE PROBLEM, NOT THE SOLUTION</h3>
		<p>There is more scientific research on human education and human behavior than at any time in history. And yet, student engagement, retention, and graduation rates are dropping faster than at any time in history. “So let me see if I understand correctly: since relying more on “Data” in public education, the worse our public education system has become?”</p>
		<p>That is what the “Data” would suggest.</p>
		<p>Maybe neither the problem nor the solution is more “Data.” Maybe what’s missing is something more “Human.”</p>
		<h3>EMPOWER TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, NOT RESEARCH AND DATA.</h3>
		<p>We’re supposed to Raise Kids, not Barriers.</p>
		<p>Hero School® human-centered research indicates it’s not the “Data,” but rather, “Serving the Data” – a learned behavior increasing over the last 15 years – that has derailed many school districts from the mission of raising academically-engaged, self-reliant and socially-productive young adults from today’s children. We are, after all, humans – not things.</p>
		<p>We believe that scientific research and technological advances should serve humanity, not the other way around. Hero School® “Circle of Life” presentations and workshops quickly re-align the “subject” and the “predicate” of the Human Education sentence by helping students, teachers and parents:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Discover and Ignite the hidden treasures lying dormant inside them</li>
			<li>Embrace and Integrate the many disparate parts of their “selves,” circumstances and environment</li>
			<li>Declare a Destination and accelerate their inner and outer journeys so they become who they want to be, need to be and must be</li>
