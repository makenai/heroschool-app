		<h3>HERO SCHOOL&reg; STRATEGIC HOMELESS INTERVENTIONS</h3>
		<p><span>Q:</span> &quot;What do you do when you encounter a homeless person on the street?&quot;</p>
		<p><span>HS:</span> Much depends on the environment as well as the comfort level and character type of the interventionist.</p>
		<h3>Hero School Interventionists are trained in <span>THREE PRIMARY APPROACHES:</span></h3>
		<p><span>1. PRO ACTIVE:</span> Interventionist asks a strategic, open-ended, human-centered question. <br>
		Ex: &quot;Man, how long have you been out here?&quot;<br>
		This is the best approach for interrupting homeless patterns before they can ask you for something.<br>
		Asking if the homeless person needs something shifts one to the Parent or Pet Owner Role and only activates extrinsic motivation and must be avoided.</p>
		<p><span>2. REACTIVE:</span> The homeless person asks you for something from you first.<br>
		Ex: “Excuse me, can I get a few dollars for the bus?"<br>
		Waiting to be asked a question is the most ineffective approach since it <span>a)</span> puts the interventionist in a "yes/no" position, under the authority of the homeless person’s personal management. Answering “yes” reinforces their management system and “begging” - Habit 1 - while answering “no” runs the risk of an argument, accusations and attack. Here, it is best not to answer.</p>
		<p><span>3. RESPONSIVE:</span> A homeless person has come up to your car while you're in it.<br>
		Ex. (Tap on the window, tries to get your attention)<br>
		Ignore the tapping and make him or her wait, like you would a salesman or other interruption at work or while dining with your loved ones. The longer you make someone wait, the more activity in the prefrontal cortex. Once you ready - in your time and on your terms - use <span>APPROACH 1.</span></p>
		<p>Remember, the only chance a person has to break free from the 4 Habits of Homelessness outside of a Hero School Experience is a strategic intervention on your terms.</p>

		<h3>Make Your School a Hero School</h3>
		<p>The Hero School Academic Engagement Model simply identifies and supplies what’s missing in Public Education. 14 years of active research with unparalleled results indicate it’s not the kids, it’s not the teachers, and it’s not the parents. It’s that the kids and their inner needs have changed faster than our education system and its need response did.</p>
		<p>When used together with student-centered educators and human-centered outcomes, Hero School Academic Engagement interventions have been shown to ignite engagement and motivate learning in hours instead of years. Even among the worst performers and behavioral students, increases in attendance and standardized test results – often more than 30% – occur in a matter of days and weeks, against historical decreases of up to 22% each year without a Hero School Intervention. That’s Change. That’s fast. And it’s uniquely Hero School.</p>
		<h3>HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO RE-WRITE THE EDUCATION SENTENCE FOR YOUR KIDS?</h3>
		<p>How did we find out what was missing in the education of American youth? We asked one overlooked, yet essential question:</p>
		<h3>WHAT DO TODAY’S YOUNG PEOPLE ”NEED TO HEAR” TO BECOME WHO THEY “NEED TO BE?”</h3>
		<p>Students today don’t need any more adults telling them “how it is,” particularly from the perspective of “how it was.” It is clear that even then adults in this technological generation could benefit from “revaluing their own values” and success definitions to see if they still hold water. What is important to you?</p>
		<p>What our youth need are teachers, coaches, experts – authentic leaders – who have the courage to first validate what is important to them, and yet who simultaneously can inspire them to learn the life strategies and often difficult lessons that will help them find their path through the integrating of their inner and outer lives</p>
		<p>Hero School® is that unique communication vehicle that quickly, seamlessly, and painlessly connects the inner needs and paths of today’s young people with the essential lessons taught by today’s educators, employers, experts and movies.</p>
		<p>Hero School® further optimizes the relationships between students and the unique role of educators, employers and experts within the Education Equation, within their community and even in the “Hero Movie” that will be their future life.</p>
		<p>Hero School® programs rapidly motivate continual learning and character development within and among students, while simultaneously motivating respect for and empowerment for and among educators and administrators.</p>
		<h3>THE RESEARCH WOULD INDICATE THAT MORE RESEARCH IS THE PROBLEM, NOT THE SOLUTION</h3>
		<p>There is more scientific research on human education and human behavior than at any time in history. And yet, student engagement, retention, and graduation rates are dropping faster than at any time in history. “So let me see if I understand correctly: since relying more on “Data” in public education, the worse our public education system has become?”</p>
		<p>That is what the “Data” would suggest.</p>
		<p>Maybe neither the problem nor the solution is more “Data.” Maybe what’s missing is something more “Human.”</p>
		<h3>EMPOWER TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, NOT RESEARCH AND DATA.</h3>
		<p>We’re supposed to Raise Kids, not Barriers.</p>
		<p>Hero School® human-centered research indicates it’s not the “Data,” but rather, “Serving the Data” – a learned behavior increasing over the last 15 years – that has derailed many school districts from the mission of raising academically-engaged, self-reliant and socially-productive young adults from today’s children. We are, after all, humans – not things.</p>
		<p>We believe that scientific research and technological advances should serve humanity, not the other way around. Hero School® “Circle of Life” presentations and workshops quickly re-align the “subject” and the “predicate” of the Human Education sentence by helping students, teachers and parents:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Discover and Ignite the hidden treasures lying dormant inside them</li>
			<li>Embrace and Integrate the many disparate parts of their “selves,” circumstances and environment</li>
			<li>Declare a Destination and accelerate their inner and outer journeys so they become who they want to be, need to be and must be</li>

		<h3>REAL-TIME PROBLEM SOLVERS</h3>
		<p>If your business is still Repeating History in staff and service areas, it may be the right things are being performed in the wrong way…or by the wrong people.</p>
		<p>Like “deja vu,” many businesses experience the same nagging problems year after year. New employees are hired, new consultants are retained, and still, your organization struggles with the same sales challenges, departmental disconnect and lack of staff motivation.</p>
		<p>Even if your consultants and employees are experts in their respective fields, the problem of “Repeating History” needs a different kind of problem solver – along with a different kind of leadership. Not all forms of leadership – and Real-Time Problem Solving  -  can be taught through today’s colleges and universities.</p>
		<p>Entrepreneurs know that the Transformational Leaders who founded our colleges and universities and industries…didn’t graduate from them. Sometimes you need a Unique Leader to achieve a Unique Outcome. </p>
		<h4>“Extraordinary individuals don’t scale. Only their songs do.” – Tiger Todd</h4>
		<p>Try replacing Bono or Mick and see how quickly U2  and The Rolling Stones become cover bands.</p>
		<h3>TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADER DEVELOPMENT</h3>
		<p>When change is required, true change leaders are required.</p>
		<p>Heroes Inc. offers more than just organizational growth strategies, staff development programs and skills training. We reignite true leadership from the inside out. With everyone. In Real Time.</p>
		<ul>
			<th>Heroes Inc. is a certified provider of Hero School®:</th>
			<li>Transformational Leadership Education</li>
			<li>Motivational Consulting Services</li>
			<li>Accelerated Learning Solutions</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The Heroes Inc. team of expert facilitators, educators, motivators, researchers and consultants will work with your heroes to troubleshoot, diagnose, and deliver strategies and solutions, virtually guaranteeing you won’t be wasting valuable time and resources on the same issues next year.</p>
		<h3>HOW DO HERO SCHOOL® SOLUTIONS WORK?</h3>
		<p>We start by inspiring staff to Want To.</p>
		<p>A Carnegie Center research study concluded that only 15% of a person’s success in the business world is based on skill proficiency. The study went on to say that the other 85% of corporate success was a combination of attitude and human communication ability. Successful client and inter-office relatability, for example, will make or break an organization’s sales forecasts, profitability, and in challenging economic times, its very existence. So while standardized trainings are important to maintaing product and service quality, creating organizational and individual change demands something more.</p>
		<p>Heroes Incorporated assists businesses, schools, and community organizations by motivating engagement, retention, and goal achievement by combining the Hero School® model with a unique formula of strategic consulting, motivational presentations and purpose maximization programming.</p>
		<p>Hero School® Awareness and Motivational Strategies are fast, able to ignite leadership and communication change with your team members in less than an hour. How valuable will this be to your organization? Utilizing Hero School® presentations and programs to quickly connect your staff with both your organization’s leadership and its clients will empower your company to drive tangible change now and for years to come.</p>
		<h3>WHAT MAKES HERO SCHOOL® FOR BUSINESS DIFFERENT?</h3>
		<p>The Hero School® Model uses principles in motion picture, history, mythology, pop culture, and literature that your audience can connect with and will relate to. Each attendee has a much higher probability of “buying in” to the essence of the program because of their connection to the characters in these creative works.</p>
		<p>Hero School® began as an effective model for producing significant motivational, character, and financial change with tens of thousands of formerly-homeless men and women, as well as with hundreds of thousands of teens. The curriculum was later adopted to myriad groups as a model for motivating human change, regardless of status or circumstances. As an antidote for specific social ills, including the lack of motivation and the lack of respect shown to adults by so many young people, Hero School® is unmatched, motivating both students and teachers, employees and managers, and accountants and engineers, by helping them to bridge chasms and develop their own unique roles in the movies that are their lives.</p>
		<p>Today, the Hero School® team of gifted contributors and experts – including business leaders, entrepreneurs, executives, human resource managers, physicians, educators, administrators, writers, sociologists, psychologists, and student leaders – continue to enhance the curriculum, adapting it to every category of business, social group, and civic organization where human change and professional development are paramount. Contact us today and let us know about the obstacles separating you and your organization from the success you deserve.</p>
